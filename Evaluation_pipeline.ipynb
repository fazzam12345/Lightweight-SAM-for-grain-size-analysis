    "# Comparative Study of Segment Anything Models for Grain Size Analysis: One Step Towards Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the core workflow for automating grain size distribution analysis in petrographic images using a lightweight variant of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Specifically, it is configured to run using **MobileSAM as an example**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code accompanies the publication \"Comparative Study of Segment Anything Models for Grain Size Analysis: One Step Towards Automation\" and is provided for code availability and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook covers:\n",
    "1.  Setting up the environment and configuring model loading.\n",
    "2.  Loading the selected SAM model variant and an example petrographic image.\n",
    "3.  Performing automatic mask generation using the SAM variant.\n",
    "4.  Visualizing the generated masks and contours.\n",
    "5.  Processing the detected masks to extract grain parameters (area, length, width, perimeter).\n",
    "6.  Loading ground truth annotations.\n",
    "7.  Matching predicted grains to ground truth annotations for segmentation performance evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1-score).\n",
    "8.  Analyzing and visualizing grain size distributions derived from the model predictions compared to ground truth.\n",
    "9.  Saving evaluation metrics and distribution data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "*   Python 3.x\n",
    "*   Required libraries: `torch`, `torchvision`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `opencv-python`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `openpyxl`. Install using pip: `pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib opencv-python pandas scipy scikit-learn openpyxl`\n",
    "*   **SAM Model Libraries:** You need the specific library or code for the SAM variant you wish to use.\n",
    "    *   For original SAM (ViT-H/L/B): Install `segment_anything` (`pip install segment_anything`).\n",
    "    *   For MobileSAM: Install `mobile_sam` (`pip install git+https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM.git`).\n",
    "    *   For other variants (SlimSAM, TinySAM, RepViT-SAM, FastSAM), you might need to clone their specific repositories and potentially add them to your `sys.path`.\n",
    "*   **Pre-trained Checkpoints:** Download the checkpoint file (`.pt` or `.pth`) for the specific SAM variant you intend to use.\n",
    "*   **Data Files:** Provide your example image file and its corresponding ground truth annotation file (expected in a JSON format matching the structure defined in the `get_sam_annotations_from_masks` function or adapted as needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure necessary libraries are installed, checkpoints are downloaded, and data files are placed in appropriate locations relative to this notebook or update the paths below accordingly.\n"

    "This notebook provides a complete workflow from mask generation using a SAM variant (demonstrated with MobileSAM) to quantitative evaluation of segmentation performance and grain size distribution accuracy against ground truth. It serves as a base for users to apply and evaluate different lightweight SAM models for automated petrographic analysis. Users can adapt the configuration parameters and model loading logic to experiment with various variants and integrate this code into larger petrographic analysis pipelines.\n"
